1 We use interface in OOP coding methodology, when we only need to design the methods that class need to use. 
This interface methods function only have the function signature but not have the definition.  
The method definition will be handled by the class that implemented the interface.

We use abstract classes when we need to inforce subclass to follow the method definition of 
base class or to override it by local methods. abstract class do not instniated, we only inherite
them to be use by our subclass.

2. getters and setters in classed are methods which used to initialize or update the local attribute of 
   of the class definition. 
   
3 The purpose of black box testing is, to give us timely testing result of a specific functionality with out 
directly dealing with the internal coding structure. 

4. Accurately defined test cases  gives the benefit of , to identify code failure in advance that caused by 
input maximum and minimum boundaries, size limits and duration of executions. 

5. error first callback is a function pattern where the first argument retured is error and next argument
   is for succesfull resutl. Asynchronuos functions follow this convention, and return first the error. 

6. fs.readSync is blocking, means it waits until process finish. 
   while fs.readFile is nonblocking, means it don't wait for process to finish, 
   but gives control to the next code line, when process finsh it fires call back function.  

7. Code function that need non blocking method like , large file reading/ writing and that take time
   need to be asynchronuos.

Section 1 

1 We use interface in OOP coding methodology, when we only need to design the methods that class need to use. 
This interface methods function only have the function signature but not have the definition.  
The method definition will be handled by the class that implemented the interface.

2 We use abstract classes when we need to inforce subclass to follow the method definition of 
base class or to override it by local methods. abstract class do not instniated, we only inherite
them to be use by our subclass.
